# GPB-ETL-Kit

This repo contains a set of Python scripts that extract information about [Genshin Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact) characters from various sources and transform it into a single JSON file that can be further utilised by [Party Builder for Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hemlo.cc/partybuilder/) ([Sources](https://github.com/man90es/Genshin-Party-Builder)).

## Prerequisites
